Balls bouncing around a browser window

I have created three balls to bounce around the browser window and change to a random color each time they hit the browser window's edge. This exercise helped me practice: styling, by adding a box-shadow to make the balls appear more 3D; animation, to have the balls move around using the x and y axis; the built-in random() function to randomize the colors of the balls; setInterval, to control how often the moveball function fires.
